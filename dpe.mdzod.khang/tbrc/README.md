## bka' 'gyur (sde dge par phud) :103 Kangyur Dege

The Derge Parpu redaction of the Kangyur was edited with great care by Situ
Panchen Chokyi Jungne (1699/1700-1774) and was carved through the efforts of Tenpa
Tsering (1678-1738) the ruler of Derge. The parpu or "first fruit" printings were sent to
the great spiritual masters of the time shortly after the carving was complete. One of them
reached the 13th Karmapa Dudul Dorje (1733/1734-1797/1798). It was this copy that was
eventually reproduced in India at the order of H.H. the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe
Dorje (1924-1981). Later protectors of the Derge Gonchen printery added texts including
new translations by Situ, which he, out of his natural humility, had omitted to include in
his own edition of the canon. These additional texts are found in later printings from the
Derge blocks.
W22084   886-988

## bstan 'gyur (sde dge) :213 Tengyur Dege

The Derge edition of the Tengyur, edited by Zhuchen Tsultrim Rinchen (1697-
1774), was a masterpiece of scholarship. The Tengyur is a collection of basic texts
translated from Indic originals and ranging over the entire range of learning. Their chief
characteristic is that all of them have been written by Indian authors. The catalog to this
edition is highly regarded as a historical source for Tibet and the Derge principality. The
edition which has been scanned here was prepared as a part of the funeral rites for H.H.
the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje (1924-1981) who passed away in Chicago. The
set reproduced here is missing the Jo bo chos chung brgya rtsa which seems to have been
added later.
W23703      1317-1518, 1521-1531

## rnying ma rgyud 'bum (mtshams brag) :46

The Nyingma Gyubum is an extraordinary compendium of tantras of the old
tradition translated into Tibetan from Indic and other languages from the 7th century
onwards. These texts were first compiled into a collection by the great terton Ratna
Lingpa (1403-1479). Subsequent scholars added texts regarded as canonical. The
Tsamdrag manuscript represents the tradition Lhalung and seems to have been copied at
the order of Tsamdrag Lama Ngagwang Drugpa (1682-1748) on the basis of a manuscript
from Gangteng. This manuscript was reprinted by the National Library of Bhutan under
the direction of H.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche (1910-1991) and Lopon Pemala. This
manuscript was subsequently reprinted in Chengdu and has thus spread throughout
China.
W21521  604-649

## bka' 'gyur (stog palace bris ma) :109

A manuscript Kangyur from the Stog Palace near Leh in Ladakh.
This was copied during the reign of Jamyang Namgyal from a Bhutanese
manuscript reflecting the Kagyu tradition; the reprint is long out of print.
The Kangyur includes a few "duplicate" translations, at least one of which
was excluded from the standard Kangyur redactions. It is thus very important
for textual studies.
